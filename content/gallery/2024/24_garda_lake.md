Although we initially planned to visit Garda, the town with which the lake is homonymous, the ride was cut short due to a marathon event taking place which made the traffic to the village practically impossible to overcome. We parked instead near Lazise and walked from there until Bardolino, where we ate a comforting evening ice cream.

In this post you'll see the highlights of our lake hike.
