This was me and Mariana's first trip outside Portugal and Venice proved to be a great decision. The weather was great, as you'll certainly tell from the pictures. We also visited the Doge palace, something that I missed the last time I visited Venice.

Strolling through the city at night also showed a different but equally gorgeous perspective of the channel city.
