In this 1-week trip to Italy, Mariana and I visited some friends in Milan and Verona, before going to Venezia for the weekend. During the week we also visited Padua during 1 day.

In this first post, some pictures of the beautiful Verona city center.

I didn't take the camera for our Opera night but I do recommend attending one Opera in the Verona Coliseum, it is an amazing venue.
