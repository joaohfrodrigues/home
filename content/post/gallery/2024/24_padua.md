In this day trip to the university city of Padua, we visited the famous Basilica and spend some time at the Saturday local market. Although we spend little time in the city, it was enough for some pictures and I am quite found of these three.

First is this couple searching for books in a city center bookstore, while the second shows a window facade with its flowers well taken care of.

Finally my favorite photo of the day, through a slightly opened door of the St Anthony Basilica, I spotted a set of priest albs hanged. The clear white of the albs immediately made me think it would make a great B&W photo and they take the center stage in this composition.
