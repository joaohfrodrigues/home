During the Month of May my friends and I try to keep the tradition of traveling together. This year, we went camping to the southern west coast of Portugal, in the village of Porto Côvo.

Our days were spent between going to the beautiful empty beaches of clear (but cold) water and visiting nearby towns. The highlights are Vila Nova de Milfontes and Sines.

## Vila Nova de Milfontes

The dune flowers were still blooming and provided nice colors to the sand.

Taking a stroll with Filipe and Tiago through the dunes near the coast.

Spotted a lone fisherman fishing on the North side of town.

## Sines

Sines surprised me with its neat city center and castle, from which you can see the shoreline.

My favorite photo of the trip was taken from here, a perfectly balanced sea and sand composition and just two (lonely) people, both walking in different directions. It's one of those shots that immediately triggers a reaction on the viewer.

## Portraits of friends

While coming back to Lisbon we stopped in Grândola and I took some portraits of João and Filipe.
